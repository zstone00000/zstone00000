- 👋 Hi, I’m Zach Stone
- 👀 I’m a data scientist with a background in linguistics research, math, and education
- 🌱 I love to learn and experiment. Professionally, I'm continuing to develop AI/ML and data skills in Python & R, but I actively maintain hobbies learning math, doing research related to dependency and graph grammars, and implementing ideas from both in code.
- 💞️ I’m driven by working on interesting problems with collaborators with different backgrounds!
